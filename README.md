# taxiboatdriver.com

A collection of totally groundbreaking, never-seen-before Markdown templates for my simple website homepage – yet another way to display a title, some text, and a button. Prepare to bask in the glory of minimalism that screams, “I tried… kinda.”

## What is this?

This repository contains the content for **taxiboatdriver.com** – a tiny, text-driven, sarcasm-friendly homepage that pretends to be simple while secretly overthinking every sentence.

### It is

- a personal landing page for Serhii (`qizh`, `;,;`, `taxiboatdriver`);
- a place to experiment with tone, structure, and micro-copy;
- a low-friction way to ship changes by editing plain Markdown instead of fighting a giant CMS.

No frameworks were harmed in the making of this site. Yet.

  ## Repository structure
  
  Current and planned files:
  
  - `index.md`  
    The main homepage content. This is where the actual “Hi, I’m Serhii and here’s why this URL exists” text lives.
  
  - `README.md`  
    You’re reading it. Meta-text about the thing that serves more meta-text.
  
  - (Optional, later) `sections/`  
    A place to keep reusable snippets, alt versions of sections, or experiments (e.g. different intros, language sections, etc.) before they get promoted to the main `index.md`.
  
  The repo is intentionally minimal so that:
  - editing content is as easy as changing a paragraph in Markdown;
  - future static-site wiring (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, custom generator, whatever) can be swapped without rewriting everything.

  ## How to use this
  
  1. **Edit the homepage**
  
     Open `index.md` and:
     - adjust sections,
     - rewrite text when your personality firmware gets updated,
     - add or remove blocks like “Languages I speak”, “Projects”, “Contact”, etc.
  
  2. **Preview locally (optional but nice)**
  
     You can:
     - use any Markdown preview in your editor,
     - or wire it into a static site setup of your choice  
       (Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, a 15-line custom generator, or a bash script duct-taped to `pandoc`).
  
     The repository doesn’t force any particular stack — it just provides content.
  
  3. **Deploy**
  
     Hook the repo up to:
     - GitHub Pages, or
     - Cloudflare Pages, or
     - any other static hosting.
  
     Point `taxiboatdriver.com` at it, and suddenly your sarcasm is globally available over HTTPS.

  ## Content philosophy
  
  Rough guidelines this repo tries to follow:
  
  ### Tone
  
  - `~70%` sarcasm and self-irony
  - `~30%` professionalism
    
  Enough seriousness to be taken seriously, enough jokes to admit we’re all winging it.
    
  ### Honesty filter
    
  Public-safe personal details only:
  - where I’m from,
  - where I live now,
  - what I do,
  - what I enjoy,
  - some hobbies and interests.
    
  Deeper, more sensitive or over-personal topics live outside the public index or in private notes.
  
  ### Plain text first
    
  Everything starts as Markdown. No design tools required to update copy.

  ## Roadmap
    
  ### Planned (or at least considered)
  
  - Traslation to russian.
  - Alternative intros for different moods (more serious / more chaotic).
  - A dedicated “Projects / Apps” section describing actual work.
  - A concise “Work with me” block with links and a less self-sabotaging pitch.
  - Optional subpages:
    - `/now` – what I’m currently focused on.
    - `/stack` – tools, devices, and tech I use.
    - `/lab` – experiments, drafts, and weird ideas that don’t fit the front page.
    
  ### Whether all of this happens depends on
  - available time,
  - amount of procrastination,
  - and how much future-me regrets writing this roadmap.

  ## Contributing is not welcome
    
  This repository is primarily maintained by **future versions of myself**.
    
  ### External contributions policy
  - Pull requests from strangers:  
    appreciated in theory, suspicious in practice.
  - Issues:  
    feel free to open one if you spot a typo, a broken link, or an especially bad joke.
  - Forks:  
    if you somehow want to reuse this structure, go ahead. Just don’t copy-paste the bio unless you also move to Koh Phangan for 11+ years.

  ## License
    
  Currently: “personal site, don’t be weird about it” license.
    
  If I add a formal license later, it will show up here. Until then:
  - feel free to take inspiration from the structure and tone,
  - but avoid wholesale copy-pasting of personal text as-is.

# Hello I’m Serhii

Also known as `qizh`, `;,;`, or `taxiboatdriver` — despite having driven exactly zero taxi boats. So far.

I design and build apps for Apple platforms, automate my house a bit too much, and live on a tropical island questioning all my life choices in a very structured, Swift-like manner.

## Where I came from

I was born and raised in Kyiv, Ukraine, back when floppy disks were still a thing and “saving your progress” meant both in games and in life.

I spent about 30 years in Kyiv:
- Learned to love tech, computers, and all things that can be taken apart and sometimes even assembled back.
- Developed a long-term relationship with logic, science, and asking “but why exactly?” about everything.
- Survived enough winters to confidently say: I’ve done my time.

Kyiv is still “home” in the deep-brain firmware kind of way, even if my IP address strongly disagrees.

## Where I live now

For the last **11 years and 9 days** (yes, I did the math), I’ve been living on **Koh Phangan, Thailand** — a tropical island famous for:
- beaches,
- parties,
- and people who said “I’ll stay for a month” and forgot to leave.

I am one of those people.

These days I live somewhere between jungle, sea, and Wi-Fi coverage, sharing the place with:
- a very opinionated Siamese cat,
- a sugar glider with parkour ambitions,
- and fish who rent a huge outdoor bowl in exchange for eating mosquito larvae.

## What I do for a living

I’m a **Swift / SwiftUI developer** building apps for:
- **iOS**
- **iPadOS**
- **macOS**
(and occasionally eyeing visionOS like, “one day…”)

What I actually do:
- Architect and implement apps with a focus on:
	- clean, modern Swift,
	- SwiftUI-first UI,
	- new platform features (yes, even the beta ones),
	- and code that future-me hopefully won’t hate.
- Play with:
	- Swift 6+ features, macros, and all the shiny new toys.
	- Async stuff, structured concurrency, and polite fights with the compiler.
- Integrate:
	- AI backends,
	- APIs,
	- and whatever else someone decided “will only take a couple of hours” (it won’t).

Short version:
> I turn coffee, bug reports, and design docs into SwiftUI views and questionable TODO comments.

## What I do for fun

When I’m not arguing with Xcode, I:

- **Photograph and film life on the island**  
  Parties, lights, people, random details — then spend an unreasonable amount of time syncing it perfectly to music in video edits.

- **Over-engineer my smart home**  
  Home Assistant, sensors, dashboards, cameras, automations — if something in the house can be automated, it probably already is or is on a YAML todo list.

- **Design things that don’t exist yet**  
  Including:
  - UI concepts,
  - playful ideas for **women’s underwear design**,
  - and other “one day I’ll actually produce this” concepts.

- **Dive into psychology and systems**  
  I enjoy picking apart:
  - human behavior,
  - motivation,
  - interactions,
  - and how all of that maps to something like a mental state machine with too many edge cases.

- **Play and tinker with tech & AI**  
  New tools, new models, new frameworks, new ways to make my life slightly easier and my setups significantly more complicated.

## Hobbies and interests

A non-exhaustive list of things my brain refuses to let go of:

- **Technology & computers** — from low-level details to UX.
- **Swift, SwiftUI & app architecture** — because one framework is never enough.
- **Psychology** — especially how people think, decide, and get stuck.
- **Physics & space** — because why not also worry about cosmic scales.
- **Genetics & neuroscience (as a curious outsider)** — understanding how much of us is wiring vs. software.
- **Electronics & gadgets** — things that click, blink, and occasionally explode (metaphorically).
- **Parties & music** — electronic, dance, and everything that feels good at 3 AM on an island.
- **Photography & videography** — capturing moments, then obsessing over color grading.

## Languages I speak

I live in one country, was born in another, and work mostly in a third language, so my vocal cords run a small multilingual startup.

- **Ukrainian** – my native firmware. The language of roots, with maximum depth and minimum user interface.
- **russian** – also my native. Often used for personal conversations, long messages, and detailed overthinking with extra nuance.
- **English** – fluent. Primary language for work, documentation, development, and arguing with compilers, APIs, and error messages.

I actively switch between these depending on context:
- English for apps, code, and tech discussions.
- russian for life, feelings, and the kind of topics that don’t belong in a commit message.

## Why “taxiboatdriver”?

Because:
- It’s slightly absurd.
- It sounds like a guy who might pick you up from a pier at 3 AM.
- It’s one of those jobs even Thai people can't apply for.

Also, if someone ever yells “taxi boat!” on the beach, I can pretend it’s free brand activation.

## If you’re here for something practical

You might want to:

- **Talk about apps**  
  - Need an app for Apple platforms?
  - Want to modernize a codebase with SwiftUI?
  - Curious how to wire AI into your app without burning it down?

- **Talk about automation**  
  - Smart home setups,
  - Home Assistant,
  - Apple/HomeKit, Matter, Thread, and Zigbee integration,
  - making your lights, sensors, and speakers behave like a tiny obedient orchestra.

- **Talk about anything from the list above** 
  Tech, space & physics, design, AI, island life, psychology, or my favorite: “how did you end up living there for over 11 years??”.

## Where to find me

Online, you’ll usually see me as:

- `qizh`
- `;,;`
- `taxiboatdriver`

If you’ve seen these somewhere near Swift, SwiftUI, AI, or smart home discussions — that was probably me.

And if you somehow landed here by typing *“actual taxi boat driver Koh Phangan”* into a search engine:
- I can’t take you to another island,
- but I can help you ship an app.
